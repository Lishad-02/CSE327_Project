Overview

Our team is currently working on a Library Management System as part of our Software Engineering course. This project focuses on adhering to key principles of software development, such as architectural patterns, coding standards, testing, and documentation. While it is not a fully comprehensive system, each team member is responsible for implementing two features following rigorous development standards.

The features I am implementing are:
1)Access Profile
2)Return Book
