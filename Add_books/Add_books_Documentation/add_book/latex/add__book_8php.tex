\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file handles adding a new book to the database. 

This script processes the form submission to insert new book details into the database. It collects data from the user input, sanitizes it to prevent SQL injection, and then inserts the book data into the \textquotesingle{}books\textquotesingle{} table. If successful, it displays a success message with a link to go back to the home page. If there is an error, the error message is displayed.
